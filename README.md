## Offline Support

This app uses [Workbox](https://workboxjs.org/) to generate a service worker as part of the build step to load quickly and work offline.

## Manifest

With Chromium based browsers for Android (Chrome, Opera, etc...), Angular 2 HN includes a Web App Manifest that allows you to install to your homescreen.

## Themes

Built in theme engine!

Current themes:
* Default
* Night
* Black (AMOLED)

More to come!

## Areas of improvement

 - Realtime updating using the Firebase SDK (may need to add option to settings so service worker can still rely on REST endpoints)
 - Server side rendering

Feel free to send me feedback on [twitter](https://twitter.com/hdjirdeh) or [file an issue](https://github.com/hdjirdeh/angular2-hn/issues/new)! Feature requests are always welcome.

## Build process

The app is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + React + TypeScript.

 - Clone or download the repo
 - `npm install`
 - `npm run dev` to run the dev server or `npm run build` to kick off a fresh build and update the output directory (`dist/`)
 - `npm run preview` to serve the production build locally

Note: The service worker is only generated for production builds. To test it:
 - `npm run build`
 - `npm run preview`

## Tests

 - `npm run test` — unit tests (Vitest + React Testing Library)
 - `npm run coverage` — unit tests with a coverage report (`coverage/`)
 - `npm run e2e` — end-to-end tests (Playwright; run `npm run e2e:install` once to install the browser)
